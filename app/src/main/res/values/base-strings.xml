            This application allows two Android devices to carry out two-way text chat over
            Bluetooth. It demonstrates all the fundamental Bluetooth API capabilites, such as:
              (1) Scanning for other Bluetooth devices
              (2) Querying the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
              (3) Establishing RFCOMM channels/sockets
              (4) Connecting to a remote device
              (5) Transfering data over Bluetooth
